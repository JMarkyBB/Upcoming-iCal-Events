A widget made for [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) using *CoffeeScript*  
Syncs upcoming events from your iCalendar  

The [icalBuddy](http://hasseg.org/icalBuddy/) command-line utility tool must be installed to run. If you install to a different directory than standard, you will need to change the path in the *command* line.

## Bug Fixes

This widget hasn't been tested extensively, but I'll try and keep it maintained. Email bug fixes to the email located in the JSON file.

## Credits

Entire widget is built around the [icalBuddy](http://hasseg.org/icalBuddy/) utility developed by [Ali Rantakari](https://github.com/ali-rantakari)  
Styling is based to match the [Countdown-Widget](https://github.com/anuragbakshi/Countdown-Widget/tree/8619663c8da9827064369c9990a9c110afa8911c) developed by [Anurag Bakshi](https://github.com/anuragbakshi)
